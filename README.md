# Mini Text
This is a bad attempt to create a text editor.
I declare this 'minimalist', but what I really mean is lacking
in features.

## Features
* Edit text
* Save files
* A Cursor
* Cursor Navigation
* Unpredicable Crashes

# How do I run it?
You've gotta have Rust installed. Go get it at [this link](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Then, run with cargo :
```
cargo run
```
